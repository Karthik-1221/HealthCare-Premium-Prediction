## Overview
This project utilizes **Machine Learning Regression** techniques to predict healthcare insurance premiums based on various factors. By analyzing historical data, the model aims to provide accurate premium estimates, helping individuals and insurance providers make informed decisions.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes trends and relationships in the data.
- **Model Training**: Implements regression models to predict insurance premiums.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assesses model performance using standard metrics.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Pandas & NumPy**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**
- **Streamlit** (for deployment)
